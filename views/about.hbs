      <h3>The most efficient way to get your groceries</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <b><i>SpeedAisle</i></b> was created for the Makers Apprenticeship September 2021 cohort final 
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created over a 2 week period, the project aims to solve the issue of terrible shopping
        lists, that make picking up your groceries a daunting experience. Most other lists will just
        stack all the items on top of each other in a checklist, in whatever order they were typed
        into the list. <b><i>SpeedAisle</i></b> lets you add your items to the categories you would
        find them in your local store, meaning that you can pick up all the items you need, when 
        you're in the place you'll find them in store! No more having to go back to around the shop 
        when you realise you've forgotten something at the till.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you prefer getting your Household items first, because those things don't get crushed
        at the bottom of your trolley? <b><i>SpeedAisle</i></b> also allows you to organise your 
        categories into whatever order you prefer, and lets you save that order to the specific store 
        you're shopping at.
